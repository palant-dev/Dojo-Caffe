<h2>iOS App - WWDC 2023 Project</h2>
Sleeping Sanctuary app talks about the curious case of human beings that deliberately deprive themselves of the most vital aspect of their health: sleep.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a sleep loss epidemic in industrialised nations. Last year, I read extensively about the important issue of sleep and became an enthusiast of the topic. As a result, I have decided to share some useful information about sleep that can be read in under 30 minutes. Awareness about sleep deprivation plays an important role in solving this social problem. <br>

While developing the application, I applied my knowledge of SwiftUI to create a distinctive user interface layout and navigation system, while keeping in mind the challenges associated with non-native components. To ensure accessibility, I integrated Dynamic Font Size and Voiceover functionality, leveraging the creation of component groups to facilitate optimal performance.<br>
